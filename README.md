# HackFusion 1.0 Project

Developed for the HackFusion 1.0 Hackathon, this project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to promote better air quality in urban areas. It integrates with the World Air Quality Index Project's API (https://aqicn.org/api/) to fetch and process AQI data, ensuring compliance with attribution guidelines. The data is dynamically rendered using the Chart.js library, presenting an interactive bar chart that allows users to visualize real-time air quality levels in key cities such as New York, London, and Tokyo, etc. The user interface, crafted with HTML and CSS, incorporates Unsplash images to enrich the user experience and promote awareness of initiatives aimed at improving air quality.
